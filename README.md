### SoK: Cryptojacking Malware

This repository contains the dataset for "SoK: Cryptojacking Malware" paper. 

The dataset is in the format of CSV. We also put the script for downloading the sources from the VirusTotal.  

We made our queries on the entire VirusTotal database (Jan 2018-May 2020) that can be accessed via VirusTotal academic API. Then, we checked if the result has the keyword "Miner" somewhere to include in our database.

The CSV file contains <first submission year, format, hash value>.
